# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can generate your token by logging in and clicking your name, and then <a href="/user/api-tokens"><b>API Tokens</b></a>.
